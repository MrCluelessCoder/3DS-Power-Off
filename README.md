3DS Power Off

The idea is to create a 3ds software to power off the console without pressing the power button in order to prolong the lifespan of it.

Tap to power off.(Broken)

Holding L button reboots EmuNand.

Holding R button reboots SysNand.

Power off function is still broken. Something needs to be fixed.

My coding is in a mess. Codes may be missing and potentially broken.
